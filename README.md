# Website-Blocker
In this Python Project, we built a GUI-based Website Blocker for Windows and Linux which will also have an option to unblock the blocked websites.

## Introduction:
In this Python Project, we built a GUI-based Website Blocker for Windows and Linux which will also have an option to unblock the blocked websites.
Website blockers are software programs that are used to block any websites on the internet and prevent us from accessing them. They are most widely used as browser extensions that “Blacklist” websites for you so that you cannot see the results from those websites. But here, we are going to create a program that blocks websites and you cannot access those blocked websites.

## Task performed:
Here are all the steps that we did to create this project :-
1. Importing all the necessary libraries.
2. Setting the hosts file location and localhost address for the project.
3. Creating a master GUI window, and placing all its components.
4. Creating a block function for the Toplevel widget to block websites.
5. Creating a nested block_websites in the block function, which will do the processing      and eventually block the desired website(s).
6. Creating an unblock function for the Toplevel widget to unblock websites.
7. Creating a nested unblock_websites in the unblock function, which will process the desired website and unblock it.

## Software/hardware details:
Python -  Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
Localhost – It is a set of hostnames that refer to your local computer to access the network services being used by your computer. These hostnames usually start with ‘127’.
Hostname – It is an IP address (not specifically on your computer) that is used to identify your computer during electronic communications.
Localhost 127.0.0.1 – It is a localhost address called the “Internet Loopback Protocol”. This address is used to establish an IP connection to the same machine or computer being used by the end-user.
Hosts file – It is an operating system file that is used to map a connection between an IP address (localhost in our case) and a domain name, before actually going to the domain name servers. It is a .txt file that contains a mapping of the IP addresses and domain names. It no longer has an extension but can still only be edited as a .txt file. It has different locations on different OSs, i.e., it has a different location on Windows and Linux, but the same location on MAC and Linux.
Web Applications - Every domain name has its own IP address and when you type that domain name on your browser, it takes you to its IP address, and vice versa.
For example, If you type 142.250.77.110 on your URL bar, it will take you to google.com, because that is Google.com’s IP address.
 
## Advantages/ Comparison with other existing methods:
1. The primary benefit of solutions for blocking web access is that they can prevent Internet users visiting websites harboring malware or ransomware, websites that are known to be fake and used for phishing attacks, and websites that hide their true identity behind a proxy server or the whois privacy feature. 
2. Unwanted Sites - One major problem with websites is that a large amount do not feature what you might call G-rated content; i.e. content for all ages. Plus for many people, the content is explicit, hateful, hurtful and very much unwanted.
Examples are gambling sites, sites for people to voice their dislike over other races, religions and more. Not only do you get crude language on the sites, you can pick up computer bugs or unwanted cookies from the sites, attract nuts and place yourself in danger if you interact with others there. So for all ages, these sites can be dangerous and unwanted.
3. Many fun sites like those offering interesting interactions with forums, fun safe games like cards or gaming like the kinds played with Xbox or Nintendo systems, are great - -but time consuming. This may be alright for time off, but for students who should be studying and adults and teens who should be working, they can cause :
- Loss in work production
- Loss in homework time
- Loss in family time
- Low grade
- Low work reviews = lower pay
Additional stress and loss in personal rest-and-relation time also results. So time needs monitored on these types of sites.

## Learning Outcomes :
This project is very practical and helped us to learn a lot about the subject and how to implement on our daily lives. We also learned about GUI application and and computer networking. We also get to know about the basic understanding of Tkinter library widgets and the messagebox components of the Tkinter library. 

## Results :
We have successfully created python website blocker for windows as well as linux where you can also unblock websites. This python project is going to be really applicable, since there are many irritating websites you might want to block. You can also use this to block Netflix, so you can focus during your classes, or for dopamine detoxification as well.
